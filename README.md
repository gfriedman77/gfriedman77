## Background

### Education 
I graduated with my master's in Business Analytics (and a concentration in data science) in May 2025 from Bentley University McCallum Graduate School of Business. Honors included High Distinction and induction into Beta Gamma Sigma. 
To learn more about my experience in the MSBA program, see: [Business Because feature](https://www.businessbecause.com/news/masters-in-business-analytics/9774/how-a-master-in-business-analytics-can-unlock-your-career-potential?sponsored=bentley-university/). 

### Career
Prior to two-years of full-time study at Bentley (including data science research and an analytics internship), I taught middle school math for a decade. For reflections from mentors and colleagues on my work across analytics, research, and teaching, see: [recommendations](https://gfriedman77.github.io/recommendations/).
